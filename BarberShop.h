// Description  : BarberShop.h class defines what an BarberShop instance is in the barber shop
// program and has two methods that would add and remove a customer from the
// program's s1 stack. s2 is an auxiliary stack that helps keep customers in
// order upon taking the nextCustomer from the stack (s1).
